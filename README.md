Qwork is an open-source research project exploring quantum computation using IBM’s superconducting quantum computers.  
Each experiment hosted here is executed on real IBM Quantum backends and released with its full JSON backend data, circuit source, and visualization code for reproducibility.

The data in this public repo is rendered at https://www.qubits.work.

Thank you!
