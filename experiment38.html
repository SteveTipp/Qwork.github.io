        <h1><center> Exploring Prime Factorization Using Shor’s Algorithm (127-Qubits) </center></h1>
        <div class="content-block">
         
This experiment uses Shor's Algorithm on IBM's 127-qubit ibm_osaka quantum computer with qiskit to factor a large semi-prime number, N = 143, using modular exponentiation and quantum phase estimation. The goal is to explore the relationship between prime factorization and the non-trivial zeros of the Riemann zeta function.<br>
This code successfully finds a period of r = 5 from the bitstring with the second highest frequency, a non-trivial factor of 143. Specifically, gcd⁡(33, 143) = 11. The other factor can be computed as:<br>
143 / 11 = 13<br>
Thus, the factors of 143 are 11 and 13.<br>




          
<p>1. Problem Definition: Prime Factorization<br>
The problem to be solved is the factorization of a large semi-prime number N into its prime factors. In this experiment, we factor N = 143, which is the product of two prime numbers:<br>
N = 11 * 13.<br>

<p>2. Introduction to Shor’s Algorithm<br>
Shor's algorithm finds the prime factors of an integer N by reducing the problem to finding the order r of a randomly chosen number a (such that 1 < a < N and a is coprime to N). The order r is the smallest integer such that:<br>
a^r ≡ 1 (mod N).<br>
Once the period r is found, we use it to compute the potential factors of N:<br>
Factors of N = gcd(a^(r/2) −1, N) and gcd(a^(r/2) +1, N).<br>

<p>3. Classical Preprocessing<br>
Before we can factor N using quantum computing, we choose a number a such that:<br>
1 < a < N and gcd(a, N) = 1.<br>
In this experiment, we choose a = 2, which is coprime to N = 143.<br>




<p>4. Quantum Circuit Construction<br>
We construct a quantum circuit using two sets of qubits:<br>
Counting qubits that are used for quantum phase estimation.<br>
Qubits representing the modular exponentiation result that are used to hold the modular exponentiation values.<br>
For N= 143, we use 8 counting qubits and log⁡_2(N) = 8 additional qubits.<br>

Hadamard Transform<br>
Apply Hadamard gates H to the counting qubits to create an equal superposition over all possible states:<br>
H∣0⟩ = 1/sqrt(2) * (∣0⟩ + ∣1⟩),<br>
so that the state of the system becomes:<br>
1/(sqrt(2^n)) * (2^n) − 1 ∑ x = 0 ​ ∣x⟩.<br>

Modular Exponentiation<br>
Apply the modular exponentiation operation, which raises a = 2 to successive powers, modulo N = 143:<br>
a^k mod N.<br>
This operation is controlled by the counting qubits and updates the modular exponentiation qubits.<br>

Inverse Quantum Fourier Transform (QFT)<br>
After applying modular exponentiation, we use the Inverse Quantum Fourier Transform (QFT) to extract the period r. The QFT transforms the basis states back into the computational basis, measuring the period in the counting qubits.<br>
The QFT for n qubits is defined by the transformation:<br>
QFT ∣x⟩ = 1/(sqrt(2^n)) * (2^n) − 1 ∑ y = 0 (e^(2πixy/2^n) ∣y⟩)<br>
This operation gives the periodicity information in the final state.<br>

Measurement<br>
Measure the state of the counting qubits to get a bitstring representing the outcome of the quantum phase estimation.<br>



<p>6. Saving and Plotting Results<br>
The quantum measurement data is stored in a JSON, including the bitstring outcomes and their associated probabilities. A histogram of the results is also plotted.<br>

The Distribution of Measurement Outcomes above (code below) shows that there are more than 200 unique bitstrings, with varying frequencies, ranging from 13 to 64 counts.<br>

Given that we will use Shor's algorithm to estimate the period r, let's analyze some of the most frequent bitstrings. To do this, we will convert the top bitstrings into their decimal representations, then attempt to infer the period r.<br>
From the top 10 most frequent bitstrings, we have:<br>
10111110: 64 counts<br>
00110010: 54 counts<br>
00110101: 53 counts<br>
10110100: 53 counts<br>
00111000: 52 counts<br>

We will compute the phase for the first two of these bitstrings by dividing the decimal representation by 2^n = 256, where n = 8 is the number of counting qubits.<br>

10111110 (binary) = 190 (decimal):<br>
θ = 190/256 ≈ 0.7421875 (~ 3/4​)<br>

00110010 (binary) = 50 (decimal):<br>
θ = 50/256 ≈ 0.1953125 (~ 1/5)<br>

The bitstring with the first highest frequency is 10111110 which corresponds to 3/4​. This indicates the first potential periodicity at r = 4.<br>

The bitstring with the second highest frequency is 00110010 which corresponds to 1/5​. This indicates second potential periodicity at r = 5.<br>

Let's try r = 4 and r = 5.<br>
For r = 4<br>
We have:<br>
N = 143<br>
r = 4<br>
a = 2 (this is the base we use for the exponentiation in Shor's algorithm)<br>
Since r = 4, we need to calculate a^(r/2) = 2^(4/2) = 2^2.<br>
2^2 = 4<br>
Now, calculate the GCDs with N:<br>
gcd((2^2) −1, 143) = gcd(3, 143)<br>
gcd((2^2) + 1, 143) = gcd(5, 143)<br>
Evaluate GCDs:
gcd(3, 143) = 1, this does not give a factor.<br>
gcd(5, 143) = 1, this does not give a factor.<br>
Thus, r = 4 does not give a factor of 11. <br><br>

For r = 5<br>
We have:<br>
N = 143<br>
r = 5<br>
a = 2 (base for exponentiation in Shor’s algorithm)<br>
Since r = 5, r/2 is not an integer, so we don't directly use a^(r/2). Instead, we calculate (2^r) mod N.<br>
Let's calculate using powers of a:<br>
(2^r) − 1 = (2^5) −1 = 32 − 1 = 31 <br>
(2^r) + 1 = 25 + 1 = 32 + 1 = 33<br>
Now, calculate the GCDs:<br>
gcd(31, 143) = 1, this does not give a factor.<br>
gcd(33, 143) = 11, this does give a factor.<br>
Thus, r = 5 does give a factor of 11.<br><br>

With r = 5, we found a non-trivial factor of 143! Specifically, gcd⁡(33, 143) = 11. Therefore, the other factor can be computed as:<br>
143 / 11 = 13<br>
Thus, the factors of 143 are 11 and 13.<br><br>

The Top 10 Most Frequent Bitstrings above (code below) shows 10111110 (64 counts) being the highest, followed by 00110010 (54 counts).<br>
There is a sharp drop-off after the top few bitstrings, with the remaining bitstrings having similar frequencies between 50 to 40 counts.<br>
Since these bitstrings are the most frequent, they likely represent rational approximations of the true phase. By converting these bitstrings to decimal and then fractions, we  were able to infer values of r.<br>

The Harmonic Frequency Analysis above (code below) shows red dashed lines representing the expected harmonics of the base period between r = 4 and r = 5. The green bars indicate the actual phase frequencies from the experiment.
<br>
The Clustering of Bitstring Frequencies above (code below) represents different clusters identified by the K-means algorithm. The most frequent bitstrings cluster at the higher frequencies, but there is no clear separation between bitstring groups.<br>
<br>

        <p></p>
        <div class="content-block">
<br>
The Heatmap of Bitstring Frequencies above (code below) shows that the bitstrings are spread across a large range of frequencies in the run, with the darkest color representing bitstrings that occur more frequently. 
<br>
The Error Distribution Plot above (code below) shows a broad spread of error values, with significant counts of errors in the 0.1 to 0.4 range. <br>
There are relatively fewer errors in the higher ranges (above 0.6).<br>
The high concentration of errors in the 0.1 to 0.4 range suggests that most of the detected phases were somewhat close to the ideal phases.<br>

The Phase vs Bitstring Index above (code below) shows no clear structure or clustering of phases around specific bitstring indices. Phases appear randomly distributed across the entire range (from 0 to 1) for different bitstrings.
<br>
The Error Grouped by Bitstring Index above (code below), shows a wide spread of error values across different bitstrings, with no clear clustering. Errors range from nearly 0 to close to 1.<br>
<br>

<br>

The Phase Differences Heatmap above (code below) shows a pattern of alternating regions of high and low phase differences, with some symmetries across the diagonal.<br> 
The structure in the heatmap suggests that certain phase pairs exhibit similar differences repeatedly, which could indicate a form of underlying periodicity in the phase distribution. The symmetry across the diagonal (where the difference is 0) highlights how the phase differences evolve.
<br>
The Cross-Bitstring Correlation Heatmap above (code below) shows a very low degree of correlation between most bitstrings, with slight autocorrelation along the diagonal.<br>
The low correlation between bitstrings suggests that the states measured are largely independent from one another. The autocorrelation along the diagonal indicates that bitstrings are correlated with themselves, which is natural. The absence of strong off-diagonal correlations is a positive sign, suggesting that there are no hidden dependencies between qubits or bitstrings that could interfere with proper operation of Shor's algorithm.
<br>
The Eigenvalue Distribution from Quantum Phase Estimation above (code below) shows that the real part of the eigenvalues is heavily clustered around ±1, with relatively fewer eigenvalues around the center of the spectrum (near 0).<br>
Eigenvalues of ±1 represent phases close to 0 or π, indicating that the algorithm detected strong periodicity at these values. The presence of fewer eigenvalues around 0 might indicate that fewer solutions or measured phases corresponded to intermediate periodicities, which might point to noisy data or insufficient sampling. Since Shor's algorithm heavily relies on detecting periodic structures in the quantum phase estimation step, this outcome suggests the algorithm was mostly successful in detecting the major periodicities (associated with ±1).<br>

The Clustering of Phases in Shor's Algorithm (code below) above shows that there appears to be no clear correlation between error rate and circuit depth. <br>
The quantum error rates don't seem to increase uniformly with deeper circuits. This may indicate that errors are more sporadic and dependent on other factors, such as gate errors or decoherence times in the qubits, rather than simply the length of the quantum circuits. 
<br>
In the end, this experiment applied Shor's algorithm to factor N = 143, specifically in relation to studying the Riemann Hypothesis and prime factorization. The Distribution of Measurement Outcomes and Top 10 Most Frequent Bitstrings showed the most likely periodic sequences corresponding to the factors of 143. The Harmonic Frequency Analysis and Clustering of Bitstring Frequencies gave insight into the underlying structure of the quantum states, showing resonances that hinted at periodicity crucial for factorization. The Heatmap of Bitstring Frequencies, coupled with the Error Distribution Plot, Phase vs Bitstring Index, and Error Grouped by Bitstring Index, gave a clear view of error patterns, helping to understand how measurement noise influenced the results. The Phase Differences Heatmap and Cross-Bitstring Correlation Heatmap showed correlations between measured states, finding the periodicity we were looking for. The Eigenvalue Distribution from Quantum Phase Estimation and Clustering of Phases in Shor's Algorithm showed the phase relationships responsible for generating the correct period r = 5, which led to finding a non-trivial factor of 143.<br> 

The second most frequent bitstring in the measurements corresponded to r = 5, which we used to calculate gcd⁡(33, 143) = 11, a factor of 143. The other factor, 143/11 = 13, confirmed the prime factorization as 11 and 13. <br>
